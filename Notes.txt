Commit "login and signup pages are created" details
Sign up page is created. But it is not fully completed. Splash screen timeout is set to 0 to make implementation easier. After implementation end, it must be rearranged. Also, sign up button does not redirect page because profile page is not designed yet.
Forgot password" option is not valid yet because how to handle that situation is not clear.
